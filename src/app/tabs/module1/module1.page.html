      <ion-card-title>Renewable vs. Non-Renewable Resources</ion-card-title>
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      <p>Renewable resources are naturally replenished on a human timescale. Solar energy, wind power, and other forms of natural energy are constantly available and can be harnessed for electricity. Fossil fuels, like coal, oil, and natural gas, take millions of years to form and are considered finite resources.</p>

      <ion-card-title>Understanding Greenhouse Gases</ion-card-title>
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      <p>Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. Carbon dioxide is the most abundant greenhouse gas emitted through human activities like burning fossil fuels. While oxygen and nitrogen are essential atmospheric gases, they don't have the same heat-trapping effect as carbon dioxide.</p>

      <ion-card-title>The Power of Composting</ion-card-title>
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      <p>Composting breaks down organic materials into usable compost. Eggshells and meat scraps (in small quantities) can be composted as they decompose naturally. However, plastic bags do not break down organically and can contaminate the compost.</p>

      <ion-card-title>Deforestation and Its Impact</ion-card-title>
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      <p>Trees play a vital role in the environment. Deforestation leads to increased soil erosion as tree roots no longer hold the soil in place. It also reduces biodiversity as animals lose their habitat. However, deforestation does not directly improve air quality. In fact, it can contribute to poorer air quality by reducing the number of trees that absorb carbon dioxide.</p>

      <ion-card-title>Conserving Water - Every Drop Counts!</ion-card-title>
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      <p>Water conservation is essential for a sustainable future. Taking shorter showers reduces water usage compared to leaving the faucet running while brushing your teeth or watering the lawn every day.</p>
